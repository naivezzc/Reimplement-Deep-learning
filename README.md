# Reimplement-object detection
## Introduction
This repository serves as a storage for re-implementations of deep learning models. 

At present, the repository includes the following models:

- Faster R-CNN [Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)

- FCOS [FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355)
